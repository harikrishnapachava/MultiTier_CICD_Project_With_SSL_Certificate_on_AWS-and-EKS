##### The setup will involve configuring the necessary infrastructure, deploying the application on AWS EC2 instances, and ensuring that each tier (presentation, application, and database) is properly integrated and monitored. Tools such as Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, and Kubernetes will be utilized to manage the build, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes, ensuring a seamless and consistent workflow from development to production.

### Key tools used in this pipeline include:
- By following this guide, you'll be able to set up a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that supports continuous delivery, helps maintain high standards for code quality, and ensures secure application deployment.

- AWS: For creating and managing virtual machines.
- Jenkins: For automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
- SonarQube: For static code analysis to ensure code quality.
- Trivy: For file scanning and vulnerability scanning of Docker images.
- Nexus Repository Manager: For managing artifacts.
- Terraform: As infrastructure as code to create the EKS Cluster.
- Docker: For containerization to ensure consistency and portability.
- Kubernetes: For container orchestration and deployment.
- SSL Certification: To secure communication between clients and the server.
